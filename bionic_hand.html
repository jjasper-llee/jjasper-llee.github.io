          <h3>Background/Origin</h3>
          <p>
             Our hands are central to how we interact with the world.
            I became fascinated by the idea of translating natural human motion into mechanical action. 
            Motivated by my interests in mechanisms, control systems, and electronics, 
            I set out to design a bionic hand that could sense and mimic the movements of a real human hand in real time.

          <h3>Engineering the Hand (Mechanics)</h3>
          <p>
            Starting from hand sketches, I iterated through multiple CAD designs to develop 
            finger joints that balanced low friction with compact spacing, preventing 
            unwanted lateral motion while preserving smooth rotation. Each joint uses a peg-and-pin 
            configuration that allows free rotation and enables spring-based actuation. I initially 
            experimented with cable-driven systems using lanyard, rope, floss, and fishing line, 
            but friction from multiple pulley turns introduced excessive resistance and poor repeatability. 
            I ultimately transitioned to a spring-based design, where carefully tuned stiffness ratios 
            allowed each finger to move in a more natural, human-like way. In retrospect, 
            this approach better resembles biological hands, in which tendons behave like 
            springs with different stiffnesses and are driven by rotational motion at the joints.

          <h3>Engineering the Hand (Electronics)</h3>
          <p>
            To actuate the hand, I used stepper motors controlled through dedicated stepper motor drivers. 
            Each driver was connected to an I²C multiplexer, enabling coordinated control of multiple motors 
            from a single microcontroller. I integrated absolute magnetic encoders at each joint to measure 
            finger angles with high resolution, and powered the entire system from a portable 5V battery pack for mobility. 
            Encoder data were streamed wirelessly to the motor controller over ESP-NOW, creating a low-latency 
            link between the wearable exoskeleton and the mechanical hand. This closed-loop setup allowed 
            the hand to respond directly to a simple bend of the user’s finger in real time.

            In this demonstration, the stepper motor responds in real time to 
          the rotation of a magnet mounted on top of an absolute encoder. 
          The motion data are transmitted wirelessly over ESP-NOW, enabling 
          fully cable-free control of the motor from the wearable exoskeleton.

          which measures joint rotation for real-time control of the robotic hand.

          <h3>Final Notes / Next Steps</h3>
          <p>
            My next step for this project would be to fully integrate the electronics into the 
            mechanical structure, consolidating wiring, mounting, and power distribution into a 
            single cohesive system. While this stage is primarily mechanical packaging in 
            CAD rather than a new technical challenge, I chose to pause here. With functional electronics, 
            reliable sensing, and working actuation already demonstrated, I consider this a successful 
            working prototype — one that is fully operational in principle, even if not yet packaged 
            in a final, polished form.
