          <h3>Background/Origin</h3>
          <p>
            I wanted to make a special Christmas present for family and friends. I decided to create an electronics circuit
            and turn it into art! The result was a spider circuit made of resistors and capacitor that allowed the spider's
            eyes to glow even after the battery is removed, due to the capacitor's relatively slow discharge.

          <h3>Engineering the Circuit</h3>
          <p>
            To create this circuit, I used a total of 19 resistors (15 of which were for decoration and in fact dissapated charge and heat).
            When the 3V battery touches the front legs of the spider, the circuit is complete and a voltage difference is inacted 
            between the two terminals, creating current through the resistors and capacitor. After a few seconds, the LED begins to 
            increase in intensity, and even after the battery is withdrawn, the LED stays lit, due to the capacitor discharging! 
            I used the following components:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>1000 micro-farad Capacitor</li>
            <li>3V Panasonic Battery/li>
            <li>Assorted Resistors</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Final Notes / Next Steps</h3>
          <p>
            I plan to come up with more complex circuits that could model more complex organisms such as animals. By removing a few legs, and adding a pair of wings
            I made a dragonfly. Meanwhile, have fun making a circuit-art yourself!
