      <h2>LUMI Cello Fingerboard</h2>
      <p class="project-tagline">The very first LED-powered & music-responsive cello fingerboard to 
        streamline the learning curve for cello, in particular, finger coordination, left hand posture and rhythm.</p>

          <h3>Background/Origin</h3>
          <p>
            As a cello mentor, I noticed that beginners often encounter finger coordination obstacles, leading to them tensing up their hands 
            as overcompensation and making themselves injury prone. As principal cellist of the San Francisco Youth Symphony Orchestra 
            and my school's orchestra, I have seen similar situations when I lead sectionals. Instead of moving their 
            fingers off of rhythm, they force their fingers to move. Inspired by my cello teacher,
            I created this illuminating fingerboard that aims to ameliorate this issue. By lighting up individual LEDs at the right moments,
            according to a programmed piece, players are able to coordinate their fingers with a live visual instructions.

          <h3>Engineering/Coding the fingerboard</h3>
          <p>
            Beginning with a piece of scrap wood I found in the garage, I drilled holes and integrated LED's into the wood to create a 
            makeshift fingerboard. I connected every row of 4 LEDs in parallel, (a total of 4 fifths across 4 strings) and had 4 rows,
            making up "first position" on the cello. This allowed me to control each LED with a simple on off program that corresponded 
            to a written music piece, enabling users to play multiple pieces, as long as they are pre-programmed into the MCU 
            (the first piece being Twinkle Twinkle Little Star). After 
            ensuring that the electrical components worked, I transitioned to a real life cello, taking apart the fingerboard and
            installing the electrical circuits.

          <h3>Final Notes / Next Steps</h3>
          <p>
            Finishing up this build, I was able to see my creation
            work in a student's hands in real-time. Future steps could be scaling up the manufacturing of
            this fingerboard so that is becomes an accessible product.
