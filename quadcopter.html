          <h3>Background/Origin</h3>
          <p>
            For this custom radio transmitter and receiver quadcopter, I decided to design a frame that encompassed all electronics without the use of layering with hex screws and bolts. This would take more time to CAD, 
            however it would ultimately be more simple and allow for straight-forward structural analysis.

          <h3>Engineering the Drone</h3>
          <p>
            I will focus on the drone-specific components (ie: the receiver and flight controller portion). Connceting my esp32-c3 to my Radio Link F722 flight controller (FC)
            through RX and TX pads, I sent signals received from the esp32-c3 over Wifi to the FC RX 2 and TX 2, which then connected to my 4 in 1 ESC that controller the motors. 
            Initially I used UART1, and the drone would not respond to my transmitter, however I later discovered that RadioLink had set UART5 to be the auxiliary channel. 
            I will be checking the channel settings first next time! I Below is a list of materials I used on the drone-side of things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Microcontroller: Esp32-c3 (Receiver)</li>
            <li>Motors: F1507 Brushless DC T-motor</li>
            <li>ESCs: 4 in 1 ESC</li>
            <li>Flight Controller: Radio Link F722 | BetaFlight </li>
            <li>Materials: Bambu Lab PLA Infill 100% </li>
            <li>Battery: Ovonic 850 mAh 3S LiPo </li>

          <h3>How IMU Attitude Affects Motor Speed in Real Time.</h3>
            <p>
              The video below demonstrates the next step of a successful RX to TX communication through Esp32 ESPNOW Wifi Protocol. Given IMU orientation 
            the flight controller responds by increaseing and decreasing throttle of each motor, evidently changing pitch, roll, & yaw. Furthermore,
            a control of thrust is shown.

          <h3>Final Notes / Next Steps</h3>
          <p>
            This project is proof that there is no need for a remote controller to control drones, all we need is this setup that I have demonstrated
            and our hand, which will be the futuristic remote controller for FPVs. Similarly, this shows that ESPNOW Wifi proves to be a reliable and quick
            radio signal protocol. However, at this stage, my setup is far from something reliable. I will need to implement multiple additional features, including 
            a safety feature for bad initial IMU orientation (to prevent the PID controller from freaking out), reliable drone vertical takeoff, and 
            IMU filters that convert noisy hand waving data into dependable positioning data similar to the modern RC transmitter.

            As for the physical frame, the ends ended up snapping when the drone flipped and crashed into the ground. This means that I will need
            to strengthn the structure between the motor mount and the drone arm. Another option is I could use SLA or PETG to print my frame, which
            would offer a stronger and stiffer solution that would sustain more impact and external forces.
