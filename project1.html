          <h3>Origin Story</h3>
          <p>
            Against the backdrop of my building a transforming tricopter drone and learning that my grandmother
            fell down the stairs, breaking her arm, unable to get her phone to call for help, I began to 
            think of ways that would allow us to manipulate and control objects beyond our physical reach, saving 
            physical contact and potential dangers.

            While many technologies address single challenges, from accessibility and exploration to search and
rescue, very few aim to create a unified solution. I am starting with one of the most versatile tools we
already have: the human hand.
My vision is an aerial bionic hand, designed to not only mirror human dexterity but also to extend our
reach into dangerous environments. With the simple extension of the arm, and flick of the wrist, we will
be able to take issues into our own hands using mechanical precision and strength to perform tasks
without risking safety. Whether it be cutting a seatbelt to free a victim trapped under earthquake rubble,
providing rapid medical support to soldiers, reaching for the phone after falling down stairs, or simply
grabbing a cup of coffee across the room, this aerial bionic hand will do it.
Unlike prosthetics or exoskeletons, this project isn’t just about replacement or enhancement—it’s about
expansion. Where numerous companies are developing prosthetics and exoskeletons, my vision goes one
step further: expanding human capability. Rather than relying on artificial intelligent robots to perform
our tasks, becoming increasingly dependent, we will remain in control of what happens around us,
commanding space beyond the limits of our bodies.
This vision builds on my previous experience of designing and building a shape-shifting tri-copter drone
from scratch, where I integrated mechanical design, flight dynamics, and control systems.

          <h3>Engineering the Solution</h3>
          <p>
            I have broken down this projct into simple categories: hardware and software. 
            
            Hardware: 
            Form the materials standpoint, the two main categories of materials I will need are 
            ultra-light and durable materials and compact hight-torque motors. With this pair I will not only 
            reduce nonlinear coupling between comparably complex bionic finger joints and flight components but will able to reduce 
            the overall weight needed for liftoff.

            From a controls standpoint
            
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Microcontrollers: Arduino Nano + ODrive</li>
            <li>Motors: Brushless DC with planetary gear reduction</li>
            <li>Control: Position + torque feedback with encoders</li>

            Share what you learned, how the prototype performed, and how you plan to iterate. Tie the story back to the
            user experience or mission and invite collaborators to reach out.
